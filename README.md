## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of basic HTML and CSS layout techniques. Some key things I learned include:

How to use Flexbox to center elements both vertically and horizontally

Structuring a simple card layout with semantic HTML

Applying consistent spacing, font sizes, and border-radius to match a design

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="qr">
  <img src="./images/image-qr-code.png"
    alt="qr-site:frontendmentor.com">
</div>
```
```css
.qr-viewer {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: space-between;
    height: 350px;
    width: 250px;
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    padding: 10px;
    border-radius: 15px;
    -webkit-border-radius: 15px;
    -moz-border-radius: 15px;
    -ms-border-radius: 15px;
    -o-border-radius: 15px;
    text-align: center;
}
```

### Continued development
I'm currently focusing on improving my front-end development skills by building more real-world projects. Iâ€™m working on becoming more confident with:

Responsive web design

Advanced CSS techniques (Flexbox, Grid, animations)

JavaScript fundamentals

Working with design systems and UI libraries

I also plan to start learning popular JavaScript frameworks like React to build more dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
